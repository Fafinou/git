Tests for Mediawiki-to-Git
==========================

Introduction
------------
This manual describes how to install the git-remote-mediawiki test
environment on a machine with git installed on it.


Prerequisite
------------

	1: Get the sources
	------------------
	To be able to run this test environment you first need to get the
	sources developped in our project, which you can download at https://github.com/Fafinou/git/ .
	Then, get our five main patches from branch master.

	2: Packages required
	--------------------
	In order to run this test environment correctly, you will need to
	install the following packages.
	* php5-cli
	* lighttpd
	* php5-cgi
	* php5
	* php5-curl
	* php5-sqlite

Run the test environment
------------------------
	1: Install a new wiki
	---------------------
	Once you have all the prerequisite, you need to install a MediaWiki on
	your machine; if you already have one, we strongly recommend you to
	install one with the script we provide. Here's how to work it:

	a) change directory to contrib/mw-to-git/t/
	b) edit test.config to choose your installation parameters
	c) run ./install-wiki.sh install
	d) check on your favourite web browser if your wiki is correctly installed.

	2: Remove an existing wiki
	--------------------------
	Simply edit the file test.config! to fit the wiki you want to delete,
	and then execute the command ./install-wiki.sh delete into the contrib/mw-to-git/t directory.

	3: Run the existing tests
	-------------------------
	The furnished tests are currently in the contrib/mw-to-git/t! directory.
	The files are all the t936* shell scripts.

	a) Run all tests
	To do so, simply go into the contrib/mw-to-git/ directory, and do Make test.

	b) Run a specific test
	To run a given test <test_name>, go into the contrib/mw-to-git/t directory and run ./<test_name>.

How to create new tests
-----------------------
	1: Available functions
	----------------------
	The test environment of git-remote-mediawiki provides you with some
	functions useful to test the behaviour of git-remote-mediawiki. for
	more details about the functions' parameters, please refer to the
	test-gitmw.pl file.

	** test_check_wiki_precond
	Checks if the tests must be skipped or not. Please use this function
	at the beggining of each new test file.

	** wiki_getpage
	Fetchs a given page from the wiki and puts its content in the
	directory in parameter.

	** wiki_delete_page

	parameters like a summary for the page edition, or add the page to a
	given category.
	Please, see test-gitmw.pl for more details.

	** wiki_getallpage
	Fetchs all pages from the wiki into a given directory. The directory
	is created if it does not exists.

	** test_diff_directories
	Compares the content of two directories. The content must be the same.
	Use this function to compare the content of a git directory and a wiki
	one created by wiki_getallpage.

	** test_contains_N_files
	Checks if the given directory contains a given number of file.

	** wiki_page_exists
	Tests if a given page exists on the wiki.
