Tests for Mediawiki-to-Git
==========================


Installation
------------
These tests require a mediawiki with admin access to work on; you can install one
on localhost/wiki simply by running:
	./install-wiki.sh install
Be aware that the tests will flush the wiki database, thus if you own a wiki at
this adress, it is strongly advised to configure another name in test-gitmw-lib.sh
before running the script.
Note that the wiki will be installed in /tmp (this can be configured too), meaning
you might have to install it again when you run tests later.


Running
-------
You can run these tests either individually or with make (recommended). Remember
to use make clean when you're done. You have access to all options from git core
tests.


Limitations
-------
This test environment does not allow you to test the behavior of git-remote-mediawiki
for name containing backslashes.

t9360: tests git clone.

t9361: tests git pull and git push.

t9362: tests how UTF-8 special characters are handled.
